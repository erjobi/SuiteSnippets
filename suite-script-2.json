The query.Column object describes the field types (columns) that are displayed from the query results.\nTo create columns:\nUse Query.createColumn(options) to create columns on the initial query definition created with query.create(options). Use this method in one of two ways:\nPass in an argument for the parameter options.fieldId.\nPass in an argument for the parameter options.formula.

For an example, see Syntax.\nWhen you create a column, you can specify a field context. The field context determines how field values are displayed in the column. For example, you can specify that a column should display raw data (such as internal IDs), consolidated or converted amounts (such as currency totals), or user-friendly values (such as names). You can specify a field context in two ways:\nUse a context from the query.FieldContext enum directly as the value of the options.context parameter. For example:\nThis example is the simplest way to specify a field context that does not accept additional parameters. Because the options.context parameter is an Object, this example is equivalent to the following:\nUse a context from the query.FieldContext enum as the value of the options.context.name parameter, and specify additional parameters using the options.context.params parameter. For example:\nIn this example, the created column displays the value of the netamount currency field using the exchange rate that was in effect on January 1, 2019 for the currency with an ID of 4.\nIn this release, only the query.FieldContext.CONVERTED context uses additional parameters. The supported parameters are currencyId and date. For the date parameter, you can pass a JavaScript Date object or query.RelativeDate object. If you pass a query.RelativeDate object using a value from the query.RelativeDateRange enum, use the start property or end property to specify the exact date of the exchange rate. For example, to use the exchange rate that was in effect at the beginning of the last fiscal quarter:\nIf you use only the query.RelativeDate object from the query.RelativeDateRange enum and do not specify either the start or end properties, the end date of the relative date range is used. This behavior means that the following two date properties are equivalent:\ndate: query.RelativeDateRange.LAST_FISCAL_QUARTER\ndate: query.RelativeDateRange.LAST_FISCAL_QUARTER.end\nThis method is a shortcut for the chained Query.root and Component.createColumn(options): Query.root.createColumn(options).

An aggregate function performs a calculation on the column or condition values and returns a single value.\nEach value in this enum (except MEDIAN) has two variants: distinct (using the _DISTINCT suffix) and nondistinct (using no suffix). The variant determines whether the aggregate function operates on all instances of duplicate values or on just a single instance of the value. For example, consider a situation in which the MAXIMUM aggregate function is used to determine the maximum of a set of values. When using the distinct variant (MAXIMUM_DISTINCT), the aggregate function considers each instance of duplicate values. So if the set of values includes three distinct values that are all equal and all represent the maximum value in the set, the aggregate function lists all three instances. When using the nondistinct variant (MAXIMUM), only one instance of the maximum value is listed, regardless of the number of instances of that maximum value in the set.\nThis enum is used to pass the aggregate function argument to Component.createColumn(options), Component.createCondition(options), Query.createColumn(options), and Query.createCondition(options).\nJavaScript does not include an enumeration type.

      "Object Description:\nEncapsulates a NetSuite record.\nThere are two modes you can operate in when you create, copy, load, or transform a record with SuiteScript 2.0: standard mode and dynamic mode.\nWhen a SuiteScript 2.0 script creates, copies, loads, or transforms a record in standard mode, the record’s body fields and sublist line items are not sourced, calculated, and validated until the record is saved (submitted) with Record.save(options).\nWhen you work with a record in standard mode, you do not need to set values in any particular order. After submitting the record, NetSuite processes the record’s body fields and sublist line items in the correct order, regardless of the organization of your script.\nWhen a SuiteScript 2.0 script creates, copies, loads, or transforms a record in dynamic mode, the record’s body fields and sublist line items are sourced, calculated, and validated in real-time. A record in dynamic mode emulates the behavior of a record in the UI.\nWhen you work with a record in dynamic mode, it is important that you set values in the same order you would within the UI. If you fail to do this, your results may not be accurate.\nThe record.create(options), record.copy(options), record.load(options), and record.transform(options) methods work in standard mode by default. If you want these methods to work in dynamic mode, you must pass in a specific argument. See the help topic for the applicable method for more information.\nUse record.Type enum for multiple records. For help finding a record’s internal ID, see How do I find a record's internal ID?\nFor more information about standard and dynamic modes, see SuiteScript 2.0 – Standard and Dynamic Modes\nFor a complete list of this object’s methods and properties, see Record Object Members.\n",

      "Method Description:\nPerforms a search for one or more body fields on a record.\nYou can use joined-field lookups with this method, with the following syntax:\njoin_id.field_name\nThe search.lookupFields(options) method also includes a promise version, search.lookupFields.promise(options). For more information about promises, see Promise Object.\nNote that the return contains either an object or a scalar value, depending on whether the looked-up field holds a single value, or a collection of values. Single select fields are returned as an object with value and text properties. Multi-select fields are returned as an object with value:text pairs.\nIn the following example, a select field like my_select would return an array of objects containing a value and text property. This select field contains multiple entries to select from, so each entry would have a numerical id (the value) and a text display (the text).\nFor \"internalid\" in this particular code snippet, the sample returns 1234. The internal id of a record is a single value, so a scalar is returned.\nIf you try to look up a field that does not exist on the specified record, an SSS_INVALID_SRCH_COL error is thrown.\n",

If a user event script calls ScheduledScriptTask.submit(), the user event script must be initiated by a role with permission.\nA scheduled script can be submitted for processing only if there is no unfinished scheduled script task for the same script ID and script deployment ID. Therefore, if a scheduled script resubmits itself, the actual resubmit does not occur until the current execution completes. This delay is necessary to avoid the existence of two unfinished tasks for the same deployment of the same script.

These scripts can call https.createSecureString(options) to decrypt the GUID and create a SecureString instance.\nThe default maximum length for a credential field is 32 characters.
