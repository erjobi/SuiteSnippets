This behavior is designed so that you can use either lower case or title case when you reference a header. However, the existence of title-case iterations of header names is not guaranteed. For best results, refer to header names using all lower-case letters (and hyphens, when applicable).\nThe request headers and their values are subject to change. If you use these headers in your scripts, you are responsible for testing them to make sure that they contain the information you need. For example, when making an HTTP call to a Suitelet, some headers might be filtered out. Filtering can occur if the headers affect how NetSuite processes the request internally. These filtered headers are not available to the Suitelet, so you should test to see whether a header was filtered out.

Each pair represents a server request header name and its value.\nTypically, this object encapsulates two iterations of each header name: one in lower case and another in title case. This behavior is designed so that you can use either lower case or title case when you reference a header. However, the existence of title-case iterations of header names is not guaranteed. For best results, refer to header names using all lower-case letters (and hyphens, when applicable).\nThe server request headers and their values are subject to change. If you use these headers in your scripts, you are responsible for testing them to make sure that they contain the information you need. For example, when making an HTTP call to a Suitelet, some headers might be filtered out. Filtering can occur if the headers affect how NetSuite processes the request internally. These filtered headers are not available to the Suitelet, so you should test to see whether a header was filtered out. If so, use a different header instead.\nFor more information, see HTTPS Header Information.\n",

For example, you can specify that a column should display raw data (such as internal IDs), consolidated or converted amounts (such as currency totals), or user-friendly values (such as names). You can specify a field context in two ways:\nUse a context from the query.FieldContext enum directly as the value of the options.context parameter. For example:\nThis example is the simplest way to specify a field context that does not accept additional parameters. Because the options.context parameter is an Object, this example is equivalent to the following:\nUse a context from the query.FieldContext enum as the value of the options.context.name parameter, and specify additional parameters using the options.context.params parameter. For example:\nIn this release, only the query.FieldContext.CONVERTED context uses additional parameters. The supported parameters are currencyId and date.

For an example, see Syntax.\nWhen you create a column, you can specify a field context. The field context determines how field values are displayed in the column. For example, you can specify that a column should display raw data (such as internal IDs), consolidated or converted amounts (such as currency totals), or user-friendly values (such as names). You can specify a field context in two ways:\nUse a context from the query.FieldContext enum directly as the value of the options.context parameter. For example:\nThis example is the simplest way to specify a field context that does not accept additional parameters. Because the options.context parameter is an Object, this example is equivalent to the following:\nUse a context from the query.FieldContext enum as the value of the options.context.name parameter, and specify additional parameters using the options.context.params parameter.

The supported parameters are currencyId and date. For the date parameter, you can pass a JavaScript Date object or query.RelativeDate object. If you pass a query.RelativeDate object using a value from the query.RelativeDateRange enum, use the start property or end property to specify the exact date of the exchange rate. For example, to use the exchange rate that was in effect at the beginning of the last fiscal quarter:\nIf you use only the query.RelativeDate object from the query.RelativeDateRange enum and do not specify either the start or end properties, the end date of the relative date range is used.

After the query is loaded, you can modify the query definition (for example, by setting additional property values), join the query definition with other query types, and execute the query in the same way as queries that you create using query.create(options).\nYou can provide either the workbook ID or the dataset ID of the query definition to load. You can obtain these IDs in the SuiteAnalytics Workbook UI. For more information, see Navigating SuiteAnalytics Workbook.\nThis method loads only the table view in the specified workbook. However, a workbook can include no table views, or it can include multiple table views. This method throws an exception in each of these cases (see Errors). If a workbook includes multiple table views, you can use query.listTables(options) to determine the ID of a specific table view. You can use this ID to load the corresponding table view.\nThe N/query module lets you create and run queries using the SuiteAnalytics Workbook query engine. You can use the N/query module to load and delete existing queries, but you cannot save queries. You can save queries using the SuiteAnalytics Workbook interface.

For example, consider a situation in which the MAXIMUM aggregate function is used to determine the maximum of a set of values. When using the distinct variant (MAXIMUM_DISTINCT), the aggregate function considers each instance of duplicate values. So if the set of values includes three distinct values that are all equal and all represent the maximum value in the set, the aggregate function lists all three instances.

For more information, see SuiteScript Analytic APIs.\nThis enum is used to specify the operator argument to Query.createCondition(options) and Component.createCondition(options). This enum is also used to specify the operator argument to methods in the N/dataset and N/workbook modules, such as dataset.createCondition(options) and workbook.createTableFilter(options). For more information, see Workbook API (Beta).\nValues for this enum are listed in the Values section. The following columns provide information about each operator:\nValue — Use these values to specify operators in most queries (for example, query.Operator.BEFORE). To use these values, you must include the N/query module in your script.\nMapped String Value — Use these values as strings that represent the corresponding operators (for example, 'BEFORE'). To use these values, you do not need to include the N/query module in your script.\nUse For — Use this column to determine the value types that each operator supports. For example, the query.Operator.AFTER operator is designed to be used with date/time values, and you cannot use this operator with string or boolean values. Some operators are similar but are designed to be used with different value types (such as query.Operator.IS for boolean values and query.Operator.EQUAL for numeric values).\nFor multi-select fields, you can use the query.Operator.INCLUDE_* and query.Operator.EXCLUDE_* values to specify a set of exact field values. For example, to obtain script deployment records that apply to all execution contexts except the WEBAPP and WEBSTORE contexts, you can use the query.Operator.EXCLUDE_ALL operator. You cannot use the query.Operator.ANY_OF_NOT operator to obtain these records, because this operator uses an implicit OR operator between all specified values. The query.Operator.EXCLUDE_ALL operator uses an implicit AND operator between all specified values, which lets you create more complex conditions.\nJavaScript does not include an enumeration type.

For example, to create a condition to match dates that occur before the current date, use the query.RelativeDateRange.TODAY enum value and the query.Operator.BEFORE enum value. To create a condition to match dates that occur after last year, use the query.RelativeDateRange.LAST_YEAR enum value and the query.Operator.AFTER enum value. For more information about relative dates, see Relative Dates in the N/query Module.\nThe values in this enum might look similar to the values in the query.DateId enum, but each enum is used for a different purpose:\nUse query.DateId enum values to create a query.RelativeDate object using query.createRelativeDate(options). After you create this object, you can use it in query conditions that you create using Query.createCondition(options) or Component.createCondition(options).\nUse query.RelativeDateRange enum values directly in query conditions that you create using Query.createCondition(options) or Component.createCondition(options). Each value in the query.RelativeDateRange enum represents a date range, and you can use these values in the values parameter of Query.createCondition(options) or Component.createCondition(options).\nJavaScript does not include an enumeration type.

After submitting the record, NetSuite processes the record’s body fields and sublist line items in the correct order, regardless of the organization of your script.\nWhen a SuiteScript 2.0 script creates, copies, loads, or transforms a record in dynamic mode, the record’s body fields and sublist line items are sourced, calculated, and validated in real-time. A record in dynamic mode emulates the behavior of a record in the UI.\nWhen you work with a record in dynamic mode, it is important that you set values in the same order you would within the UI. If you fail to do this, your results may not be accurate.\nThe record.create(options), record.copy(options), record.load(options), and record.transform(options) methods work in standard mode by default. If you want these methods to work in dynamic mode, you must pass in a specific argument. See the help topic for the applicable method for more information.\nUse record.Type enum for multiple records. For help finding a record’s internal ID, see How do I find a record's internal ID?\nFor more information about standard and dynamic modes, see SuiteScript 2.0 – Standard and Dynamic Modes\nFor a complete list of this object’s methods and properties, see Record Object Members.\n",

You must run the Import Assistant to set up the necessary mapping for the CSV import. You can use a sample file or files to set up the mapping. Note the following information:\nScript ID for import map.\nAny required linked files.\nFor more information, see Importing CSV Files with the Import Assistant.\nUse task.create(options) to create the CsvImportTask object.\nUse the CsvImportTask object properties to set the script and deployment properties.\nUse CsvImportTask.submit() to submit the import task to the NetSuite task queue.\nUse the properties for the task.CsvImportTaskStatus object to get the status of the import process.\nUse the following guidelines with the CsvImportTask Object:\nCSV imports performed within scripts are subject to the existing application limit of 25,000 records.\nYou cannot import data that is imported by (2-step) assistants in the UI, because these import types do not support saved import maps. This limitation applies to budget, single journal entry, single inventory worksheet, project tasks, and website redirects imports.\nThis object has access only to the field mappings of a saved import map; it does not have access to advanced import options defined in the Import Assistant, such as multi-threading and multiple queues.\nEven if you set options to use multiple threads or queues for an import job and then save the import map, these settings are not available to CsvImportTask. When this object submits a CSV import job based on the saved import map, a single thread and single queue are used.\nFor a complete list of this object’s methods and properties, see CsvImportTask Object Members.\n",

For more information, see SuiteCloud Processors.\nYou can add a dependent task in the following ways:\nProvide a task.ScheduledScriptTask object or task.MapReduceScriptTask object that represents the dependent task as the only parameter to this method.\nProvide an Object as the only parameter that includes values for the following properties:\ntaskType\nscriptId\ndeploymentId (optional)\nparams (optional)\nFor descriptions of these properties, see Parameters.\nYou can add only scheduled scripts or map/reduce scripts as dependent tasks to asynchronous query tasks. Other script types are not supported. You can add only one dependent task per call to QueryTask.addInboundDependency(options).\nWhen you use this method to add a dependent task, the added task is considered an inbound dependency of the query task. For example, if you add a scheduled script task to a query task as a dependent task, the scheduled script depends on the query task. Because QueryTask.addInboundDependency(options) is called on the query task, any dependent task that you add is considered an inbound dependency.\n",

If the script status is set to Testing on the Script Deployment page, this method will not place the script into the scheduling queue.\nIf the deployment status on the Script Deployment page is set to Scheduled, the script will be placed into the queue according to the time(s) specified on the Script Deployment page.\nOnly roles with the SuiteScript Scheduling permission or Administrators can run scheduled scripts executed by API. If a user event script calls ScheduledScriptTask.submit(), the user event script must be initiated by a role with permission.\nA scheduled script can be submitted for processing only if there is no unfinished scheduled script task for the same script ID and script deployment ID. Therefore, if a scheduled script resubmits itself, the actual resubmit does not occur until the current execution completes. This delay is necessary to avoid the existence of two unfinished tasks for the same deployment of the same script. For this reason, if a scheduled script uses the submit() method to resubmit itself, then at runtime, no task ID is returned when the scheduled script is submitted.\n",

The translator function is called with any parameters that you specify, and the translator function returns the appropriate translated string.\nWhen you create a Translation Collection in the NetSuite UI, you can include parameter placeholders in your translation strings. Translation strings that include placeholders are called parametrized translation strings. Placeholders use braces and a number (starting from 1). The translator function injects the specified parameter values into the placeholders in the translation string.\nFor example, “Hello, {1}!” is a valid translation string, where {1} is a placeholder for a parameter. If you call translation.get(options) and specify a parameter of “NetSuite”, the translator function returns “Hello, NetSuite!” in the appropriate locale.\n",

These scripts can call https.createSecureString(options) to decrypt the GUID and create a SecureString instance.\nThe default maximum length for a credential field is 32 characters.
